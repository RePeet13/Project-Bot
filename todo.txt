progress bar on template check
progress bar on create project
raise exceptions in the load classes (so can catch and figure out what happened)
return json in simple check (not the one thats supposed to return true/false)
catch exceptions at parsing time to gain insight to where the problem was
have a log file with date in name (start with 'tmp.log' and rename at end, put timestamp as first line, use as filename, drop into project dir)
have logging method that takes in level and message and logs to both console and file
